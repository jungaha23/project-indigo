The main goals of the website is to provide a user-friendly interface... landing page with recently released books, search bar, user profile page, and a recommended/browsing page. Our target audience will use the website to track their reading progress, find new books/authors, and connect with other book-lovers.

Add a list of your groups's brainstormed features list

- Personal library

## Related Work

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?

Our website is based off the popular social book app/website called GoodReads which is owned by Amazon. GoodReads has many complaints regarding its user-interface, rating system, book searchability, and recommendation algorithm. Our project will stand out because of its fresh user-oriented designs and improved rating system that allows partial points.

## Open Questions

What questions do you still have? What topics do you need to research more for your project?

We need to research the capabilities of the Google Book API, how to make better user-friendly designs, and understand the problems of the GoodReads app/website.
